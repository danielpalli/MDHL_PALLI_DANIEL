              RULES OF PLAY & POLICIES

            <h3>SPORTSMANSHIP</h3>
            <p class="texto-general">
              The common interest that members of the Association share is to
              inspire youth to practice the ideals of sportsmanship and fair
              play. Any player, coach, team, parent, spectator, administrator or
              referee whose behavior detracts from this purpose is subject to
              disciplinary action regardless of technical hockey background,
              expertise, accomplishments or standing.
            </p>
            <h3>IHF FIELD REGULATIONS</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <strong>DIMENSIONS.IHF</strong> Law 1 provides for flexible external field
                dimensions within a given maximum and minimum width and length.
                These dimensions should be adhered to for all fields used by
                teams under 12 and older.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>COMPETITION FIELDS.</strong> Fields used within the competition program
                must be a minimum of 100 x 60 yards.Leagues, districts or
                associations participating in the state competition program that
                are unable to provide a field that meets these minimum
                requirements must advise the State Competition Board which will
                assign its Fields Committee to inspect the field and recommend
                to the Board whether or not a waiver of the minimum dimensions
                should be granted. Teams from leagues, districts or associations
                that are unable to provide an acceptable field may be required
                to play all their games away.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>FIELDS USED BY YOUNG AGE GROUPS</strong>

                    penalty areas. Fields for older age groups should be
                    progressively larger.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    U-8 plays on a field 40-50 yards in length and 20-30

                  <li>
                    In addition, fields used by young age groups may have
                    their internal dimensions and size of goal similarly
                    modified.

                A Coach shall be permitted to not play a player 50% of each
                game under special circumstances, e.g., unexcused absences from
